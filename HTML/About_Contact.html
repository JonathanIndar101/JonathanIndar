                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The Ministry of Agriculture, Land, and Fisheries of Trinidad and Tobago plays a crucial role in the management and development of the country's agricultural resources, land use, and fisheries. Its history reflects the evolution of agricultural policies and governance in the context of Trinidad and Tobago's colonial and post-independence eras. </p>
            <h3>Colonial Background</h3>
                <p>During the colonial period, agriculture in Trinidad and Tobago was focused on plantation crops, particularly sugarcane and cocoa, which were key exports. Agricultural management was overseen by colonial administrators, with no centralized ministry. Policies were largely designed to benefit the colonial economy rather than local farmers or sustainable development. </p>
             <h3>Formation of the Ministry</h3>
             <p>The formal establishment of a dedicated agricultural ministry occurred during the early 20th century, as agricultural challenges such as declining productivity, pests (e.g., the Witches' Broom Disease in cocoa), and soil degradation demanded focused intervention. By the mid-20th century, the colonial government created departments dedicated to agriculture, which were precursors to the modern ministry. </p>
